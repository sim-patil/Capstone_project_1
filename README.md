# Predict 911 calls for violent and property crimes in San Francisco city

## Problem Statement:

The problem this capstone project aims at solving is predicting calls for service (911 calls) for violent and property crimes in San Francisco city. By analyzing a variety of data such as previous calls time, date and location,the project aims at coming up with a model that could accurately predict the number of call in a given timeframe.

## Approach:

The problem was divided into several steps:

1. **Data Wrangling:** The datasets were uploaded to a dataframe and explored. Null values were filled in wherever appropriate and polluted values were discarded.

2. **EDA:** Extensive data visualisation was used to extract insights and pattern from the dataset.

3. **Inferential Statistics:** Hypothesis tests were built to derive the statistical significance of the features. 

5. **Machine Learning:** Various regressors were tested and their accuracy recorded. The best regressor was then hyperparamter tuned using Grid Search Cross Validation. This model was then fit on the test data and the best model was obtained.

## Final Results:

The following Insights were given.

1. There is a spike in no. of calls for violent and property crimes during summer.
2. Most number calls are expected to happen at 3.00 pm so authosrities can implement proactive strategies to reduce the calls in the future at this time.
3. Aggravated Assault is mostly reported from noon till midnight.In short, San Francisco is as safe as any big city neighborhood. But at night, it's wise for everyone to stick to streets with lots of foot traffic, or travel with an equally alert, sensible companion.
